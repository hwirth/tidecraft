TODO
====
[E] Drag from yard: Ship position different before and after moving the div to the table
[ ] Introduce Board()
[?] Ship: Sunk: Mark fields around it as "attacked"
[ ] Ship: Sunk: Don't change color of TD, but of the div.ship (grid.player only, or when ships shown on opponent)
[?] Ship: Show div/image in opponent grid, when sunk
[E] Ship: Too long by 1px?
[ ] AI: Find rest of ship, once a hit is landed
[E] Take hit: Counts down, when same cell hit twice
[ ] README.md + screenshot
[\] Allow dragging ship back to yard (for rotating)
[!] Passing so many callbacks might be "subsribing to events", maybe use a real observer pattern.
